I am currently a Postdoctoral Appointee for the Computational Data Science group at Sandia National Laboratories working with Erin C.S. Acquesta and Jaideep Ray. I received my PhD in [Biomathematics](http://bma.math.ncsu.edu/) with a concentration in [Mathematics](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University under the supervision of Kevin Flores. I was also a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) fellow and an associated graduate student at the [Center for Research in Scientific Computation](https://crsc.ncsu.edu/). I received my BS in Computational Mathematical Sciences at Arizona State University.

My research interests include developing mathematical models, machine learning, and inverse problem methods, with applications to biology and medicine.
