I am a fifth-year PhD student in [Biomathematics](http://bma.math.ncsu.edu/) with concentration in [Mathematics](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University. I am also a National Science Foundation Graduate Research fellow, a member of [Flores lab](https://kbflores.wordpress.ncsu.edu/), and an associated graduate student at [Center for Research in Scientific Computation](https://crsc.ncsu.edu/). I received my BS in Computational Mathematical Sciences at Arizona State University.

My research interests are in developing mathematical models and inverse problem methods with applications to biology and medicine.
